/****************** Exercise 1 ********************/

// Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
  





/****************** Exercise 2 ********************/

// Create a for loop that logs the numbers 4 to 156 to the console.








/****************** Exercise 3 ********************/

// Given the following array, log the sentence, "I really like the color: [COLOR]" for each of the items.
const favoriteColors = ["red", "blue", "purple", "yellow"];









/****************** Exercise 4 ********************/

// Use a for loop to calculate the sum of even numbers from 2 to 20






/****************** Exercise 5 ********************/

// Use a for loop to reverse a given string.
const inputString = "hello";
let reversedString = "";
// Output should be "olleh"











/****************** Exercise 6 ********************/

// The factorial of a positive number is the product of all positive numbers less than or equal to it. So, in this case, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which equals 120.

const num = 5; // The number for which we want to calculate the factorial
let factorial = 1;


// Calculate the factorial of a number using a for loop







/****************** Exercise 7 ********************/


// Initial investment amount
const initialAmount = 1000;

// Annual interest rate (in decimal form)
const annualInterestRate = 0.05;

// Number of years
const years = 10;

console.log(`Initial Investment: $${initialAmount}`);
console.log(`Annual Interest Rate: ${annualInterestRate * 100}%`);
console.log(`Number of Years: ${years}`);

// Calculate the interest on an investment using a for loop
